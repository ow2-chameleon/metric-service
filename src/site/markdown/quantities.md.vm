# Quantities

A <a href="apidocs/org/ow2/chameleon/Quantity.html">quantity</a> represents an amount of a certain type of data
(kind). A quantity is represented by value (Number) and an Unit. As measures, quantities are immutable.

Quantity's kinds
----------------

Each quantity have a `kind`. For instance: Illuminance, Velocity, Mass are kinds. Only quantities of the same kind
are comparable, can be added or substracted.

Each kind is represented by a class. The package `org.ow2.chameleon.metric.quantities` contains the quantities
provided by the library. The following class gives an example of kind of quantity.

    public class Angle extends Quantity<Angle> {

        public static Unit<Angle> RADIAN = MetricService.getInstance().getSystemOfUnits("SI").getUnitByName("radian");

        public static Unit<Angle> STERADIAN = MetricService.getInstance().getSystemOfUnits("SI").getUnitByName("steradian");

        public Angle(Number number, Unit<Angle> unit) {
           super(number, unit);
        }
    }

It is recommended to declare the units associated to the kind in the class. In the previous example,
the radian and steradian units are declared and so are easily accessible.

Obviously you can implement your own kind.


Creating quantities
-------------------

There are several ways to create quantities: from the quantity kind or from the quantity class.

Using the quantity's kind is the easiest way to create a quantity.

    Quantity<Force> force = new Force(10.0, Force.NEWTON);

Alternatively, you can create a quantity directly from the Quantity class.

    Quantity<Force> force = Quantity.valueOf(10.0, Force.NEWTON);

Manipulating quantities
-----------------------

Quantities from the same kind can be added or subtracted. The results always a **new** quantity object:

    Quantity<Mass> mass1 = new Mass(10); // Use the default mass unit (gram)
    Quantity<Mass> mass2 = new Mass(10, Mass.GRAM);

    Quantity<Mass> mass3 = mass1.add(mass2);
    Quantity<Mass> mass4 = mass1.sub(mass2);

Quantities can also be multiplicand by a constant:

    Quantity<Mass> kilo = (new Mass(1)).times(1000);

Comparing quantities

Converting quantities
---------------------

Quantities can be converted to another unit. Notice that conversion are possible only if a known converter or a chain
of known converters exist. (A known converter is a converter registered in the conversion engine). Converter are
often declared when declaring a _transformed_ or a _prefixed_ unit.

Conversions are very simple to use:

    Quantity<Mass> mass = new Mass(100, Mass.GRAM);
    Quantity<Mass> converted = mass.as(Mass.KILOGRAM); // converted.value=0.1, converted.unit=kg

Notice that, as for manipulation operations, conversions return new quantities objects.

    Quantity<Temperature> temperatureInK = new Temperature(1000, Temperature.KELVIN);
    Quantity<Temperature> temperatureInF = temperatureInK.as(Temperature.FAHRENHEIT);
